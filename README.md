# Customstyles
# Hi This is for testing
**Version 2.4**
## Test
{:.quote}Welcome to the full test template for the github md import feature of AEM. This document covers all the styles availalbe and how to implement.
Note:when loading github url into your page, it may take a number of tries to get the content to refresh. 


{:.greyHighlight}I am working with IT to resolve the bug. If you have just done an update in GitHub, then the already existing function for styles will be added

Another Item we are exploring is the ability to call the css that is used on the site. This isn't working yet. I will update once we have the functionality in place. There are two options IT is exploring. 
We have requested that IT add this feature so we can call certain css properties into markdown.

## Headers (H2)

{:.note}Make sure you don't use the single # for any headers. Only the title of your article should be an H1. This isn't just a visual thing, this will impact your SEO score in google.Always start with the ##.

### Footnotes 
Footnotes aren't working as expected. I have raised a ticket with IT to see if they can enable this feature.
```markdown
Here's a sentence with a footnote. [^1]  
  
[^1]: This is the footnote.
```
Here's a sentence with a footnote. [^2]  
  
[^2]: This is another footnote to go with the first.
